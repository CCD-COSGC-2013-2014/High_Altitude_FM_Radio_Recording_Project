## Community College of Denver / Colorado Space Grant Consortium:

## EOSS DemoSat:  High-Altitude FM Radio Recording Project

### Fall 2013 / Spring 2014




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### PROJECT OVERVIEW:

We placed two FM radio recorders inside payloads attached to weather balloons, 
then recorded FM radio broadcasts to altitudes exceeding 100,000 feet.




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### MAIN OBJECTIVE:

"To record an FM radio frequency on which one station is broadcast, and then 
have the recording automatically change to a stronger station broadcasting 
from a different location on that same frequency once it reaches that 
station's altitude-to-line-of-sight".




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### RESULTS:

We were successful in achieving our main objective on both frequencies in 
Spring 2014.  Furthermore, we were able to attach our FM radio recordings to 
our GoPro video of the ascent to create the "Spring 2014 processed videos for 
distribution".  These videos are the highlight of our project and are only 
available from [[MIRROR 2: direct link]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1l2vIvQeInSRp2tGQYZVMj7qbZEKa2LxJ).
